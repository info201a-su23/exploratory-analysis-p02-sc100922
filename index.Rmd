### Abstract

Our main question is to analyze the geographic patterns and temporal trends of gun violence incidents in the United States. This question is important because it allows people to identify high-risk areas and to find potential ways to prevent gun violence. To address the question, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset obtained from Kaggle, examining changes in the frequency of gun violence incidents over time and exploring potential patterns or correlations with demographic factors.
