### Abstract

Our main question is to analyze the geographic patterns and temporal trends of gun violence incidents in the United States. This question is important because it allows people to identify high-risk areas and to find potential ways to prevent gun violence. To address the question, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset obtained from Kaggle, examining changes in the frequency of gun violence incidents over time and exploring potential patterns or correlations with demographic factors.

### Introduction  

Gun violence is a serious problem that affects residents in the United States. Our project aims to analyze the geographic patterns of gun violence and the reasons behind gun violence in the United States by using the dataset we found from Kaggle. The dataset includes date, location, number of people that were killed, and number of people that were injured of each gun violence incident that were documented from 2013 to 2022.

The research questions that we'll be focusing on are:

1. How has the number of gun violence incidents changed over time in different states and cities? 
2. Are there any seasonal or temporal patterns in gun violence incidents? 
3. Does gun violence differ in cities, suburbs, and rural areas? 
4. Does demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity intersect with gun violence trends? 

The motivation behind our research questions is driven by an urgent need to combat gun violence in the United States. We want to figure out if thereâ€™s any certain trends of gun violence by either location, group of people, seasons of the year, etc. By analyzing these questions, we can better understand gun violence and the potential reasons behind it. Since it affects the safety and well-being of all residents in the United States, studying the trends over time and across different areas can help us to learn more about the factors that contribute to gun violence and find ways to prevent it.

### Related Work  

Our topic is investigating the gun violence happened in past several years around the United States. Firstly, We analyze from the locations and draw a map to show which area is affected by gun violence most and least. Secondly, we analyze from the time, we will compare the data through the timeline to find out the rising and falling rate of gun crimes in some areas. Thirdly, we analyze the number of injuried people and death to speculate the type of un-supervised gun around that area. Besides these, we will keep doing more researchs based on the dataset and get more meaningful results. Finally, The result of analysis can be used by the federal governments to enhance security work or used by local government to improve citizens' safety. Why we are doing this analysis? We want to make this land under our feet to become a safer and more trust-worthy environment for anyone who lives than any moment before.
